# Moin it's Manu! Welcome to my github profile

I am a front-end developer from Germany who is always eager to learn new things. Currently it's hybrid app development which is on my plate.

Our planet is very important for me. Due to this I am not only striving for a sustainable way of living but also for finding resource saving solutions in my daily work with my current knowledge.

I spend my free time playing video/board games 🎮, pen and paper RPGs and every now and then sports. You could think I'm a nerd... but hey. I'm also trying to develop a game at the moment.
