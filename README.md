# Moin it's Manu! Welcome to my github profile

I am a front-end developer from Germany 🇩🇪 who is always eager to learn new things. Currently it's hybrid app development which is on my plate. 🤤

I spend my free time playing video/board games 🎮, pen and paper RPGs 🧙‍♂️ and every now and then sports 💪. You could think I'm a nerd... but hey. I'm also trying to develop a game at the moment.
