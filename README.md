# Moin it's Manu! Welcome to my github profile

I am a front-end developer from Germany 🇩🇪 who is always eager to learn new things. Currently it's hybrid app development which is on my plate. 🤤

Our planet is very important for me. Due to this I am not only striving for a sustainable way of living but also for finding resource saving solutions in my daily work with my current knowledge.

I spend my free time playing video/board games 🎮, pen and paper RPGs 🧙‍♂️ and every now and then sports 💪. You could think I'm a nerd... but hey. I'm also trying to develop a game at the moment.
