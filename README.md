## Interests

Because of the global climate change and the necessarity to act against it I am always interested in solutions how we as developers can make our software sustainable and resource saving.

I spend my free time playing video/board games ðŸŽ®, pen and paper RPGs and every now and then sports. You could think I'm a nerd... but hey. I'm also trying to develop a game at the moment.
